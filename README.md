# Open Arena

<img src="open-arena.png" width="28%" align="right" alt="Open Arena logo">

Autoresearch loop for reward-R&D and model selection in the modern
LM ops stack — between post-training evals and the next round of
fine-tuning / RL. An agent iterates on candidate rewards under
`src/rewards/`, validates them by running an evaluation sweep across a
(model × dataset) grid, and keeps the rewards whose rankings best
agree with each dataset's task-specific primary reward. **Configured
entirely from YAML**; experiment management on top of `keras-tuner`.

Plugs into every major LM provider — OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini,
Mistral, Cohere, Groq, Together, DeepSeek, xAI, OpenRouter, Azure,
AWS Bedrock, Doubleword, plus self-hosted Ollama / vLLM — and pulls
eval datasets from Langfuse, LangSmith, Opik, Arize Phoenix, and
Braintrust (or any HF / local / folder source). Each dataset can run
as a single-shot `Generator` eval or as a multi-step
`FunctionCallingAgent` driven by MCP tools.

## Install

Requires Python 3.10+ and [`uv`](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv).

```bash
git clone <this repo> && cd open-arena
uv sync                # installs deps + the `arena` console script
cp .env.example .env   # fill in only the providers you actually use
cp config.example.yaml config.yaml
```

For local LLMs, point `OLLAMA_API_BASE` at your Ollama server (defaults to
`http://localhost:11434`). Cloud providers are routed through litellm — any
`*_API_KEY` variable from `.env.example` works (OpenAI, Anthropic, Gemini,
Mistral, Cohere, Groq, Together, DeepSeek, xAI, OpenRouter, Azure, AWS).

## Run

```bash
arena                          # uses ./config.yaml
arena -c configs/eval.yaml     # different config
arena --no-cache               # discard the .kt/ trial cache and start over
```

`arena --help` for the full option list.

## Launch the autoresearch agent

A coding agent (Claude Code, Codex, Cursor, etc.) reads `AGENTS.md` /
`CLAUDE.md` on startup. Both files instruct the agent: when the user
asks to **start the research loop**, the agent should open
`AUTORESEARCH.md`, walk through Setup with you (run tag, branch,
smoke-tests, baseline `results.tsv`), wait for confirmation, then enter
the autonomous experiment loop and not stop until you interrupt it.

Trigger phrases (any of these, or an obvious paraphrase, kicks it off):

- "start the research loop"
- "begin autoresearch"
- "run autoresearch"
- "kick off the autoresearch loop"

After confirmation, the agent edits `src/rewards/`, commits, runs
`uv run python -u evaluate.py > .kt/run.log 2>&1`, scores the sweep
with `analyze.py`, logs to `results.tsv`, and either advances or
reverts the branch — repeating indefinitely. See `AUTORESEARCH.md` for
the full protocol.

## Configure

A minimal `config.yaml`:

```yaml
datasets:
  mmlu_test:
    type: huggingface
    path: cais/mmlu
    name: all
    split: test
    streaming: true
    limit: 50
    batch_size: 1
    input_template: |
      {"messages": [{"role": "user", "content": {{ ("Q: " ~ question ~ "\nA) " ~ choices[0] ~ " B) " ~ choices[1] ~ " C) " ~ choices[2] ~ " D) " ~ choices[3]) | tojson }}}]}
    output_template: |
      {"role": "assistant", "content": {{ ["A","B","C","D"][answer] | tojson }}}
    generator:
      temperature: 0.0
      instructions: "Reply with one letter: A, B, C, or D."
    reward:
      name: exact_match
      in_mask: [content]

default: mmlu_test

experiments:
  language_models:
    - ollama/mistral
    - ollama/llama3.2
  datasets:
    - mmlu_test
```

Each `datasets:` entry carries its own `generator:` (instructions,
temperature, etc.) and `reward:` because both are task-dependent. The
sweep iterates the cross product `experiments.language_models ×
experiments.datasets`.

`config.example.yaml` is the full menu — every dataset provider and
reward type with annotated examples.

### Dataset providers

| `type:` | Source |
|---|---|
| `huggingface` | HuggingFace `datasets` library |
| `local` | JSONL / CSV / Parquet on disk |
| `folder` | Folder of files, one record per file (JSON / YAML / text / markdown) |
| `langfuse` | [Langfuse](https://langfuse.com) datasets |
| `langsmith` | [LangSmith](https://smith.langchain.com) datasets |
| `opik` | [Comet Opik](https://www.comet.com/docs/opik/) datasets |
| `phoenix` | [Arize Phoenix](https://arize.com/docs/phoenix) datasets |
| `braintrust` | [Braintrust](https://www.braintrust.dev) datasets |

All providers stream rows through Jinja2 templates that render to JSON
matching the input/output data models (the defaults are chat-message
shapes — a list of `{role, content}` for inputs, a single message for
outputs).

### Rewards

| `name:` | What it does |
|---|---|
| `exact_match` | String-equality on the masked fields |
| `cosine_similarity` | Cosine over `embedding_model` outputs |
| `lm_as_judge` | Single-LM judge |
| `recursive_lm_as_judge` | RLM agent inside a `ProgramAsJudge` — inspects the (gold, prediction) pair with code, recursively delegates semantic comparisons to a sub-LM |
| `judge_panel` | M small LMs vote in parallel; on disagreement (max-min spread > `agreement_threshold`) a smart LM breaks the tie |

`in_mask: [content]` on every reward keeps the comparison restricted to
the `content` field of the chat message, ignoring `role` and friends.

### Agent mode (function-calling + MCP)

A dataset that declares an `agent:` block runs as a multi-step
`FunctionCallingAgent` instead of a single Generator call.
MCP servers are declared once in a top-level `mcp_servers:` registry
and referenced by name from each agentic dataset:

```yaml
mcp_servers:
  math:
    transport: stdio
    command: python
    args: ["/abs/path/to/math_server.py"]
  weather:
    transport: streamable_http
    url: http://localhost:8000/mcp

datasets:
  agentic_math_eval:
    type: folder
    path: data/agent_cases
    pattern: "*.json"
    batch_size: 1
    input_template: |
      {"messages":[{"role":"user","content":{{ question | tojson }}}]}
    agent:
      type: function_calling          # only supported value
      mcp_servers: [math]             # references the registry above
      max_iterations: 5
      autonomous: true
      use_chain_of_thought: true
      instructions: "Solve step by step using the available tools."
    reward:
      name: deep_eval
      metric: ToolCorrectnessMetric
```

`agent:` and `generator:` are mutually exclusive on a dataset. Tools
are loaded from the listed MCP servers at trial-build time via
`MultiServerMCPClient.get_tools()` so a misconfigured server fails the
trial fast rather than producing a tool-less agent. Any
`FunctionCallingAgent` constructor kwarg can be set under `agent:`
except `language_model`/`tools`/`data_model`/`schema`, which are wired
from the model and the dataset.

### Experiment-level rewards

Generic rewards that apply to every `(model, dataset)` trial, on top of
that dataset's primary reward:

```yaml
experiments:
  rewards:
    - name: lm_as_judge
      alias: lm_judge
      language_model: ollama/llama3.2
      in_mask: [content]
      instructions: "Score 0.0–1.0 on factual correctness."
    - name: recursive_lm_as_judge
      alias: rlm_judge
      # `language_model` drives code generation + structured submit, so it
      # must be a capable model — small Ollama models can't do this
      # reliably. `sub_language_model` (used for `llm_query`) can be cheap.
      language_model: openai/gpt-4o
      sub_language_model: openai/gpt-4o-mini
      in_mask: [content]
      max_iterations: 8
      max_llm_calls: 10
      instructions: "Score 0.0–1.0 on factual correctness."
```

Each one renders an extra matrix at the end of the run. Each one also
costs an additional evaluation pass per trial (the underlying program
only accepts one reward at compile time), so K experiment rewards = K×
the model calls of the primary run.

The purpose is to test generic open-ended rewards.
